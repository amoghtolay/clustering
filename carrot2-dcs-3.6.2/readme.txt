Carrot2 Document Clustering Server
----------------------------------

Carrot2 Document Clustering Server exposes Carrot2 clustering as a REST
service. It can cluster documents from an external source  (e.g., a search
engine) or documents provided directly as an XML stream. Results are returned
in XML or JSON formats. 

The DCS requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6.0 or later. To
run the DCS, execute the 'dcs' script and point your browser at
http://localhost:8080 for further instructions.
